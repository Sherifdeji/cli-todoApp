1. Todo List Manager (File-Based) 
Description: 
Build a command-line application to manage a todo list. The data should be stored in a file 
(e.g., JSON file), and users can add, remove, and view tasks. 
Features: 
1. Add a task with a description and due date. 
2. Mark a task as completed. 
3. Remove a task by ID. 
4. List all tasks (completed and pending separately). 
5. Save all tasks to a JSON file and load them on startup. 
Focus Areas: 
● File system (FS module) for reading/writing JSON. 
● CLI input handling (process.stdin and process.stdout). 
● Modular design with classes for Task and TodoManager.
